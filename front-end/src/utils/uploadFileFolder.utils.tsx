/**
 * This function processes a file upload by generating a unique name for the file, reading the file,
 * creating a file for the directory, and creating file information.
 * @param {File} file - The file that needs to be uploaded.
 * @param externalDirectory - An array of objects representing the directory structure of the files
 * being uploaded. Each object contains properties such as id, parentId, name, isFolder, iconUrls,
 * children, and path.
 * @param externalFilesInformation - An array of objects representing information about files that have
 * been uploaded. Each object contains an id, name, body (file content), language, and iconUrls.
 * @param {IIcon} fileIcons - an object containing URLs for icons used to represent different file
 * types.
 * @param [isNameUnique=true] - A boolean value indicating whether the file name should be unique or
 * not. If set to true, a unique name will be generated for the file. If set to false, the original
 * file name will be used.
 * @param [parentId=root] - The ID of the parent directory where the file will be uploaded. If not
 * specified, it will be uploaded to the root directory.
 * @param {string} dirPath - A string representing the path of the directory where the file will be
 * uploaded. It is used to create the path of the file and to update the path of the directory after
 * the file is uploaded.
 * @returns Nothing is being returned explicitly in this function. However, it is an asynchronous
 * function that returns a promise that resolves to undefined.
