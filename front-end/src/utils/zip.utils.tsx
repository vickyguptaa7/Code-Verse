 * object has properties such as "name", "isFolder", and "children" (if it is a folder).
 * @param {string} dirPath - dirPath is a string representing the path of the current directory being
 * processed. It is used to create the correct file path when adding files to the zip.
 * @param {IFilesInforation} filesInformation - An object containing information about the files to be
 * added to the zip. The keys of the object are the IDs of the files and the values are objects
 * containing the body of the file as a Blob.
